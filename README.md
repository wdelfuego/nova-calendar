# What can it do?
This calendar tool for Nova 4 shows existing Nova resources and, if you want, dynamically generated events, but comes without database migrations or Eloquent models itself. This is considered a feature. Your project is expected to already contain certain Nova resources for Eloquent models with `DateTime` fields or some other source of time-related data that can be used to generate the calendar events displayed to the end user.

The following features are supported:

- Automatically display Nova resources on a monthly and / or weekly calendar view
- Mix multiple types of Nova resources on the same calendar
- Display events that are not related to Nova resources
- Use event filters to limit the amount of events shown on the calendar
- Add badges to events and calendar days to indicate status or attract attention
- Customize visual style and content of each individual event
- Laravel policies are respected to exclude events from the calendar automatically
- Allows end users to navigate through the calendar with hotkeys
- Allows end users to navigate to the resources' Detail or Edit views by clicking events

# What can it not do (yet)?
The following features are not (yet) supported:

- Integration with external calendar services
- Creating new events directly from the calendar view
- Drag and drop to change event dates

Please create or upvote [feature request discussions](https://github.com/wdelfuego/nova-calendar/discussions/categories/ideas-feature-requests) in the GitHub repo for the features you think would be most valuable to have.
