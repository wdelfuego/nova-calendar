# Usage

## Clicking events
When users click events generated from Nova resources, they are sent to the URL returned by the `urlForResource` method in your CalendarDataProvider.

## Hotkeys
You can navigate through the months using the hotkeys `Alt + arrow right` or `Alt + arrow left` and jump back to the current month using `Alt + H` (or by clicking the month name that's displayed above the calendar).
