## Running tests
This package comes with a basic test suite that will be expanded as we run into issues. 

You can run the test suite directly from the Nova project in which you are using it.

1. Make sure `phpunit` is available in your project as a dev dependency (it's present by default in new Laravel projects so it's probably already there).

1. Open your project's `phpunit.xml` and add the following entry to the `<testsuites>` node:
    ```xml
    <testsuite name="NovaCalendar">
      <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/wdelfuego/nova-calendar</directory>
    </testsuite>
    ```
    Make sure to use the correct package path if your local fork of this package is located in a different directory.

1. Run the test suite by running the following command from your project's root directory:
   ```sh
    phpunit --testsuite NovaCalendar
   ```

    If the test suite completes as expected, you should see something like this:

    ```console
    PHPUnit 9.5.23 #StandWithUkraine    

    ...........................                                       27 / 27 (100%)

    Time: 00:02.155, Memory: 26.00 MB

    OK (27 tests, 106 assertions)
    ```
